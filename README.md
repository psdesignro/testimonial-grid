## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I haven't used CSS grid for a while, but I'm glad I managed to do it correct from start. Of course, I have chosen the most basic approach, but I will refine my CSS grid skills for the next projects. 
I also start to understand better the use of SASS and how it can keep my code clean.


```css
@mixin responsive-960 {
  @media (min-width: 960px) {
    @content;
  }
}

.container{
  display:grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  gap:24px;
  

  @include responsive-960 {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}




### Continued development

I will practice more the CSS Grid to create fully responsive designs and also SASS, to get an optimized version of CSS.
